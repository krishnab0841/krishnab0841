## Hi there 👋 I'm Krishna

I’m a **Data Analyst / Data Scientist / AI & ML Engineer** who enjoys turning messy data into useful intelligence and building AI systems that actually work outside demos.

I like working at the intersection of **data, machine learning, and generative AI**, especially where models meet real users.

---

### 🔭 What I’m working on
- Building **LLM-powered applications** using RAG, LangChain, and Hugging Face
- Designing **end-to-end ML pipelines** (data → model → inference)
- Exploring **multimodal AI** (text, image, audio, video)
- Improving retrieval accuracy and reducing hallucinations in GenAI systems

---

### 🌱 What I’m currently learning
- Advanced **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** strategies  
- **Vector databases** (FAISS, pgvector) and relevance tuning  
- Model optimization, prompt engineering, and evaluation techniques

---

### 👯 Looking to collaborate on
- Generative AI projects  
- ML / DL research-oriented projects  
- Real-world data science problems with measurable impact

---

### ⚡ Fun fact
I enjoy solving problems where the **answer isn’t obvious**, the data is messy, and the model needs to be *argued with* before it behaves.
